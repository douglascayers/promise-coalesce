## Reporting Security Issues

**Security Matters to Us**

We take security issues seriously.
If you've discovered a security problem and want to help, we appreciate it!
We'll do our best to acknowledge your help.

**How to Report a Security Issue**

To tell us about a security problem, follow these steps:

1. Go to our [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/douglascayers/promise-coalesce/security/advisories/new) page.

2. Click on "Report a Vulnerability".

3. You'll receive a response from our team, explaining what comes next.

**What Happens Next**

Once you've reported a security issue, we'll keep you updated on how we're fixing it and when we'll announce the solution.
We might ask for more details to help us understand the problem better.

**Reporting Security Issues in Third-Party Modules**

If you find a security problem in a module created by someone else, get in touch with the folks who maintain it.
You can also use the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) and select "I'm reporting a security vulnerability."
